Your armature should be a connected chain of bones, with or without an IK handle. More bones = tighter slithering.


# Features

* **Axis:** animate across the X, Y, or Z axis
* **Amplitude:** how extreme the slither is
* **Flexibility:** stiff (dinosaur tail) or loose (tentacle)
* **Head or tail:** start slither from head or tail
* **Speed:** keyframe spacing
* **Duration:** animation duration


# Animate a full snake body

The head/tail animations are separate. To animate a full snake body, create a half-head-half-tail rig and apply the head/tail animations separately. You may have to move and scale the keyframes so that the head/tail animations synch up.


# 🥀 Limitations
* Head/tail animations must be implemented separately due to the head-tail nature of Blender bones
* Can only slither along 1 axis
* Animation speed is scaled by the number of bones, not constant


# For the eggheads

The math behind this is just a repeating sine wave function: 

`Amplitude * Nth bone * sin(Angle +/- (Nth bone * Flexibility))`

* `Angle` increases indefinately<br>
* `Amplitude` affects how extreme the slither arc is
* `Nth bone` staggers the bone arc amount from head to tail<br>
* `+` for head movement, `-` for tail movement<br>
* `Flexibility` makes bones at the tip arc more severely than root bones
