# Features

* **Axis:** animate across the X, Y, or Z axis
* **Amplitude:** how extreme the slither is
* **Flexibility:** stiff (dinosaur tail) or loose (tentacle)
* **Head or tail:** start slither from head or tail
* **Speed:** keyframe spacing
* **Duration:** how long the animation is

Your armature should be a connected chain of bones, with or without an IK handle. More bones = tighter slithering. You can also skip bones when you select them

# Animate a full snake body

The head/tail animations are separate. To animate a full snake body, create a half-head-half-tail rig and apply the head/tail animations separately. You may have to move and scale the keyframes so that the head/tail animations synch up.


# Limitations
ü•Ä Some annoyances:
* Head/tail animations are separate due to the head-tail nature of Blender bones
* Can only animate along 1 axis at a time
* Animation speed is scaled by the number of bones, not constant
* Amplitude/Flexibility is extremely sensitive


# For the eggheads

The math behind this is just a repeating sine wave function: 

`amplitude * Nth bone * sin(angle +/- (Nth bone * flexibility))`

* `angle` increases indefinately<br>
* `amplitude` affects how extreme the slither arc is
* `Nth bone` staggers the bone arc amount from head to tail<br>
* `+` for head movement, `-` for tail movement<br>
* `flexibility` makes bones at the tip arc more severely than root bones
